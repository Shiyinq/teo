            "description": "Manages files and directories within allowed locations. You can combine these functions to perform complex tasks. All paths must be within permitted directories.\nAvailable functions:\n- \"read_file\": Reads the entire content of a single specified file.\n- \"read_multiple_files\": Reads contents of several files at once. Provide paths as a JSON array or comma-separated string for the 'path' argument.\n- \"write_file\": Creates a new file or overwrites an existing one with provided content. Use with caution.\n- \"edit_file\": Performs line-based edits on a text file. Specify start/end lines and new content. Returns a diff.\n- \"create_directory\": Creates a new directory. Can create nested directories. Silent if directory already exists.\n- \"list_directory\": Lists all files and subdirectories in a specified directory, marking type (FILE/DIR).\n- \"directory_tree\": Provides a recursive JSON tree view of files and directories from a starting path.\n- \"move_file\": Moves or renames files/directories. Fails if destination exists.\n- \"search_files\": Recursively searches for files/directories matching a case-insensitive pattern.\n- \"get_file_info\": Retrieves detailed metadata (size, type, modified time, permissions) for a file or directory.\n- \"list_allowed_directories\": Shows the list of directories this tool can access.\n- \"delete_path\": Deletes a specified file or directory. Use the 'delete_recursive' boolean parameter to delete non-empty directories.\n\nConsider chaining these operations. For example: list files with `list_directory`, read one with `read_file`, modify it with `edit_file`, then verify with `get_file_info`. Or, create a directory structure with `create_directory` then populate it using `write_file` or `move_file`.",
